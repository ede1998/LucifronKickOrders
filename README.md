# LucifronKickOrders
A small addon that finds kick orders for Sulfuron adds and announces them in /raid warning.

## Why is it called LucifronKickOrders and not SulfuronKickOrders?
Because I'm dumb and mixed the bosses up and because I'm too lazy to change it now.

## How to use?
Just type `/lucifronkickorders` or `/lfko`.
